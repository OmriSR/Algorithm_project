# Algorithm_project
The algorithm creates an undirected graph from data (read from main arguments) and an exstra edge X.
The algorithm will return the MST's weight using Prim & Kruskal algorithms,
then remove X from the graph and calculate (if possible) the MST's weight in the new graph created using Krusal algoritm

In the Prim implementation minimum binary heap ('RemoveEdge(x)' methos add) data structure as a priority queue ADT, and in Kruskal we used a disjoint-set forest.
